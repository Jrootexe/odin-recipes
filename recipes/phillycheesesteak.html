            <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>10 to 12 ounces ribeye steak</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 medium sweet onion, sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
                <li>2 ounces (3 slices) provolone cheese</li>
                <li>2 hoagie rolls, toasted</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Cheez Whiz, warmed</li>
                <li>fresh thyme, for garnish, optional</li>
            </ul>

            <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Place steak in the freezer on a sheet pan for 
                about 10 minutes so it gets very cold but not 
                frozen through.</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>Trim off any large pieces of fat normally around 
                the edges of the steak, but some veins of fat in 
                the middle of the steak are good. Then slice the 
                steak as thin as possible with a sharp knife. You 
                will not be able to get it paper thin without a 
                meat slicer, but slice as thin as you can. Season 
                steak with salt and pepper.</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>In a large skillet set over medium heat, add 1 
                tablespoon of olive oil along with sliced onions and 
                peppers. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook, 
                stirring occasionally, until the onions and peppers have 
                softened and start to caramelize around the edges, 12 to 
                15 minutes. Donâ€™t rush them!</li>

                 <p></p>

                <li>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 
                the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the sliced steak. 
                Spread out the steak in the skillet in a thin even layer so 
                it covers as much surface area as possible. Cook for a minute 
                or two and then stir to finish cooking the steak. It might 
                need another minute or two, but it will cook very quickly.</li>
                
                <p></p>

                <li>Turn heat down to low on the steak and add the peppers and 
                onions to the steak mixture and stir to combine. Add the 
                provolone slices to the top of the steak mixture and let the 
                cheese melt. Stir to combine, once the cheese has melted.</li>
                
                <p></p>

                <li>Evenly scoop the cheesesteak mixture into the toasted hoagie 
                rolls. The hoagie rolls should be packed! Optionally, drizzle 
                the cheesesteaks with warm Cheez Whiz for maximum cheesiness. 
                Sprinkle fresh thyme over top and serve. </li>
