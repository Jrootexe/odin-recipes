                <p><strong>For The Lasagna</strong></p>
            
                <li>1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 extra-large eggs</li>
                <li>2 cups freshly grated pecorino Romano</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
                <li>1 pound mozzarella, grated</li>
                <li>16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles</li>
            </ul>

            <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>For the sauce, heat ½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven 
                or kettle over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and 
                pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions
                 are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Raise 
                 heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly 
                 reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, 
                 and add their juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm 
                 water. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>

                 <p></p>

                <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the 
                parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the 
                beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your 
                hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended. Shape 
                into meatballs and set aside.</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Dust the meatballs lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and 
                lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not 
                cook through) and transfer to the sauce.</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. 
                Transfer to the sauce. Simmer 1½ hours.</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the 
                ricotta, eggs, pecorino Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup 
                of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and pepper. Mix 
                thoroughly.</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set 
                aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick 
                layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. 
                Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon more sauce on top, then 
                add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. 
                Repeat for 2 more layers, using all the meat and cheese. Top 
                with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. 
                Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 
                minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
